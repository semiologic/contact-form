A widget-driven contact form.


== Description ==

The Contact Form plugin for WordPress allows you to manage contact forms on your site.

It is widget-driven, and plays best with widget-driven themes such as the Semiologic theme, especially when combined with the Inline Widgets plugin.

= Placing a Contact Form in a panel/in a sidebar =

It's short and simple:

1. Browse Appearance / Widgets
2. Open the panel of your choice (or sidebar, if not using the Semiologic theme)
3. Place a "Contact Form" widget in that panel/sidebar
4. Configure that contact form widget as needed

Usually, no configuration will be required unless you wish to change the email that receives your correspondence.

Common places to insert a form automatically include:

- To the top/middle right of your site in a wide sidebar. Users commonly swipe their mouse to the top right corner of their screen, and eyeballs generally look for it in that area once they're done reading.
- After all posts ("After The Entries" panel.)

= Embedding a contact form in a static page =

As much as a form is nice in a large sidebar, you'll usually want it in a static page:

1. Open the Inline Widgets panel, under Appearance / Widgets
2. Place and configure a Contact Form widget
3. Create or edit your "Contact Us" page; note the "Widgets" drop down menu
4. Select your newly configured contact form in the "Widgets" drop down menu to insert it where your mouse cursor is at

= Google Analytics integration =

Combining this plugin with the Google Analytics (GA) plugin adds an interesting bonus. Specifically, contact form usage gets tracked as page events.

= WP-Hashcash and Akismet integration =

To fight increasingly common contact form spam, the plugin integrates with WP-Hashcash and Akismet. Both of these do an excellent job at fighting spam. (The first is slightly more efficient, and free.)


= Help Me! =

The [Semiologic forum](http://forum.semiologic.com) is the best place to report issues.
